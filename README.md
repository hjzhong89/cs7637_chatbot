CS 7637: Georgia Tech Assistant Chatbot
===

This project was developed for CS 7637: Knowledge Based AI

The Georgia Tech Assistant Chatbot assists students with questions about 
professors and courses at Georgia Tech. Using Standord's NLP library, the 
Chatbot extracts meaning and intent from a user's input. When asked about a 
course or professor at Georgia Tech, the Chatbot provides a response from a 
template. If the Chatbot is asked about non-Georgia Tech related topics, it
will attempt to provide a response by using Google's Search API to search for
and return a summary by Wikipedia on the topic.
